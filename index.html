  <!-- SCREEN 0 — WELCOME -->
  <section class="screen active">
    <p>Thank you for taking the WHO Thoughts Assessment™.</p>
    <p>Take a moment to imagine what’s possible when you stay anchored in your Values, operate from your best self, and recognize the thoughts that quietly pull you off course.</p>
    <p>When your nervous system is regulated, you are powerful. You respond instead of react. You choose instead of spiral.</p>
    <p>Self-command isn’t about perfection — it’s about awareness. It’s about noticing when you’ve drifted from your WHO and knowing how to return.</p>
    <p>My goal is to help you uncover and celebrate the best parts of what make you you — the strengths and natural qualities that already exist within you — and show you how to use them to move through conflict with clarity and confidence.</p>
    <p>Now imagine a world where more of us faced challenges this way: grounded, intentional, and self-led.</p>
    <p>The WHO Thoughts Assessment™ is your invitation to reflect, reconnect, and reclaim the thoughts that shape your life.</p>

  <!-- STEP 1 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <p>Conflict is best solved by breaking it into smaller parts. External conflict (tacticals about what to do/how to do something) and internal conflict (your thoughts about why you labeled something a conflict).</p>
    <p>Identity also has an external (physical attributes, roles, titles, achievements) and internal component (your WHO).</p>
    <p>Your WHO is defined by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Values — Your guardrails</li>
      <li>Pillars — Your energy source</li>
      <li>Ideal Emotion — Your compass</li>
      <li>Trigger — Your warning signal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Conflict happens when you believe your WHO has been threatened.</p>
    <p>In 6 steps, you’ll identify:</p>
    <p><strong>Values:</strong> Your non-negotiables and how you think the world should act. When you are living in alignment with your Values, they are what help you to achieve your goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Pillars:</strong> Your natural characteristics that describe who you are as your happiest, most relaxed self. They are your strengths, and when you are in a flow state.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideal Emotion:</strong> What you want to feel each day. Your emotional compass.</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> The “I’m not ___ enough” story that pulls you off course.</p>

  <!-- STEP 2 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h3>Step 1 of 6: Values (Discover)</h3>
    <label>Prompt A: Proud Moment</label>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <label>Why were you proud?</label>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <label>Prompt B: Upset / Anger / Frustrated Moment</label>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <label>What exactly bothered you / Why did the behavior bother you?</label>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <h3>Build your Values candidate list</h3>
    <p>Reflect on what matters to you. What are the non-negotiable rules that drive your success? Tap to select 3–6 of your Values OR add custom ones. We’ll road-test on the next step.</p>
    <input placeholder="Add a candidate (press Enter)" />
  </section>

  <!-- STEP 3 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h3>Step 2 of 6: Values Evoke Emotions (Road Test)</h3>
    <p>Road test each candidate. Values, when crossed, evoke an emotion.</p>
    <p>If someone violates this, do you feel upset / angry / frustrated?</p>
    <p>YES = it’s a Value (keep)</p>
    <p>NO = it’s not a Value (remove from the list)</p>
    <p>Practical Application:</p>
    <p>Clarity comes by identifying conflicting Values.</p>
    <p>Use your Values as guardrails when making tough decisions.</p>
    <p>Let them guide your boundaries in relationships and work.</p>
    <p>By identifying these candidates, you can more easily de-escalate your emotions.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- STEP 4 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h3>Step 3 of 6: Pillars (Discover)</h3>
    <p>Are positive core characteristics that describe you at your best (they are not tied to accomplishment or how you think you "should be"). You are great as you are!</p>
    <p>When were you your happiest and most YOU?</p>
    <textarea></textarea>
    <h3>Step 4 of 6: Pillars (Road Test)</h3>
    <p>If someone crosses this characteristic, do you get angry/frustrated/upset?</p>
    <p>If you took these characteristics away, would you be a shell of yourself?</p>
    <p>Practical Application:</p>
    <p>Lead from your unique strengths.</p>
    <p>Lean on your Pillars when challenges feel heavy.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- STEP 5 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h3>Internal Conflict & Choice</h3>
    <p>Internal conflict comes from Competing WHO traits.</p>
    <h3>Step 5 of 6: Ideal Emotion</h3>
    <p>Your Ideal Emotion is what you want to feel each day.</p>
    <select>
      <option>Calm</option><option>Clear</option><option>Joy</option><option>Peace</option>
    </select>
    <input type="range" min="1" max="10" />
    <h3>Step 6 of 6: Trigger (Anti-WHO)</h3>
    <p>Your Trigger is one loud “I’m not...” story that surfaces when you feel under pressure.</p>
    <input placeholder="I'm not..." />
    <textarea placeholder="Optional Reset Script"></textarea>
  </section>

  <!-- STEP 6 -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h3>Your WHO Snapshot</h3>
    <p>Values — Your guardrails</p>
    <p>Pillars — Your energy source</p>
    <p>Ideal Emotion — Your compass</p>
    <p>Trigger — Your warning signal</p>
    <p>Refine over time. Awareness builds self-command.</p>
